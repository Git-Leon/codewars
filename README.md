# Advanced Whiteboard Preparation

## How to Start
* Make clarifying statements about the question
    * If there are subclasses of the given datastructure, clarify which children we should expect
        * Is this a `DoublyLinkedList`, `SinglyLinkedList`, `ThreadSafeLinkedList`, etc.
* Re-explain the problem back to interview
* Consider test cases of the problem
    1. Consider a case where input is null
    2. Consider a case where input is single element
    3. Consider a case where input is multiple elements
    4. Consider a case where input is tested against performance
    5. Consider a case where solution is accessed by multiple threads
